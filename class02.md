## Article: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Greater efficiency: 
   * It is easier to catch mistakes in the making.
   * It takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging.
   * When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own. 
   * Pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.

2. Engaged collaboration: 
    * When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
    * It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.
    * When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help. Ultimately, this boosts overall confidence.
    
3. Learning from fellow students:
    * Working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
    * If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area. The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.

4. Social skills: 
    * Pair programming help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself.
    * This has long-term career impacts. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.

5. Job interview readiness:
    * For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

6. Work environment readiness.
