# Functional programming

- What is functional programming?
  -Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data


- The first fundamental concept we learn when we want to understand functional programming is pure functions.

- What does pure functions really mean? What makes a function pure? 
  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic) It does not cause any observable side effects. It returns the same result if given the same arguments


# Refactoring

- Refactoring means updating the source code without changing the behaviour of the application. Refactoring helps you keep your code solid, dry, and easy to maintain.
